Current practices in software development are anchored in the use of version control systems to 
manage the development progress of software projects. Additionally, version control systems can  
be used to drive the release process of software products, by managing different variants of the main 
product in a repository. Despite the benefits of versioning systems, using such systems requires 
developers to interrupt their development work in order to interact with them, affecting their productivity. 
This paper presents CollabIDE, a collaborative environment for 
distributed development designed for automated versioning and product variant generation. The goal 
of CollabIDE is to increase developers' productivity, therefore, we conducted a small empirical study with 
users working in distributed teams, measuring the time to complete different tasks using versioning, and 
the ease to release different products' functionality based on recorded versions.
