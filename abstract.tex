Current practices in software development are anchored in the use of version control systems to 
manage the development progress of software systems. Additionally, version control systems can also 
be used to drive the release process of software systems by managing different variants of the system 
in a repository. Despite the benefits of versioning systems, using such systems requires developers to 
interrupt their development work in order to interact with them, affecting their productivity. This paper 
presents CollabIDE, a collaborative environment for 
distributed development designed for automated versioning and product line generation. since the goal 
of CollabIDE is to increase developers' productivity, we conducted a small empirical study with users 
working in distributed teams, measuring the time to complete different tasks using versioning, and the 
ease to release different products' functionality based on recorded versions.
