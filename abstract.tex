Current practices in software development are anchored in the use of versioning control systems to 
manage the development progress, or drive the release process. Despite the benefits of versioning 
systems, using such systems requires developers to interrupt their workflow in order to interact with 
them, affecting their productivity. This paper presents CollabIDE, a collaborative environment for 
distributed development designed for automated versioning and product line generation. since the goal 
of CollabIDE is to increase developers' productivity, we conducted a small empirical study with users 
working in distributed teams, measuring the time to complete different tasks using versioning, and the 
ease to release different products' functionality based on recorded versions.
