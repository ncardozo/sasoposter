\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

CollabIDE is a development environment prototype for distributed teams, incorporating automated versioning and enabling the generation of multiple software products according to the code's versions base.

CollabIDE is developed with the goal of increasing the productivity of software development teams by reducing the time developers must dedicate to tasks other than  coding. CollabIDE specifically targets the versioning and product variant deployment tasks of the software development prcess
With the experiment results we concluded that CollabIDE effectively helps in reducing the overhead 
problems. Although the scale of the experiment was small, it shows the potential that an approach like 
CollabIDE has. Thanks to the flexibility of the technology used to create the IDE, there is a range of 
improvements that can still me made to CollabIDE to make it even better at solving the problem.  

As future work, weplan to conduct a more extensive case study to evaluate the relevance of CollabIDE in larger development teams. Additionally, we see the value of the tool for code reviews, therefore we want to extend CollabIDE with code productivity metrics (\eg Lines of Code, code clones) and analysis facikities~\cite{}. Such extension would enable code reviewers to better evaluate the productivity of particular developers. CollabIDE, can be particularly useful in academic/teaching environments to quickly differentiate how much a particular student participated in an assignment, when did the majority of the work took place.
