\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

CollabIDE is a development environment prototype, for distributed teams, incorporating automated versioning and enabling the generation of multiple software products according to the code's versions base.

With the experiment results we concluded that CollabIDE effectively helps in reducing the overhead 
problems. Although the scale of the experiment was small, it shows the potential that an approach like 
CollabIDE has. Thanks to the flexibility of the technology used to create the IDE, there is a range of 
improvements that can still me made to CollabIDE to make it even better at solving the problem.
