\title{Learning Behavioral Adaptations from the Context}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Version Control Systems (VSC) have become a fundamental part in software development projects. Among the benefits of using version control are having the change history of every file for traceability and branching and merging for working on independent streams of changes. With version control, development teams see an improvement in efficiency and reduce the risk of losing progress in the project. One software development model that greatly benefits from a VSC is Distributed Software Development (DSD). In this model team members are geographically distributed and must collaborate remotely. VSC mechanisms like commiting, pushing and merging help team members solve synchronization and coordination problems that arise in DSD. However, these mechanisms introduce an overhead problem that stems from the interruption in the coding workflow the developers make when they perform an action related to version control. Initially this overhead problem may not have much impact on the project but in the long term, the productivity of the team can be negatively affected.
