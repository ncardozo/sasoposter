\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Version Control Systems (VSC) have become a fundamental part in software development projects. 
Among the benefits of using version control are having the change history of every file for traceability 
and branching and merging for working on independent streams of changes. With version control, 
development teams see an improvement in efficiency and reduce the risk of losing progress in the 
project.
One software development model that has gained substantial popularity in recent years is the 
Distributed Software Development model (DSD). This model brings various advantages to 
development teams like costs reduction, increased productivity and ease of finding human talent 
across the globe. In this model team members are geographically distributed and must collaborate 
remotely. Mechanisms like commiting, pushing and merging help team members solve synchronization 
and coordination problems that arise in DSD. However, these mechanisms introduce an overhead 
problem that stems from the interruption in the coding workflow the developers make when they 
perform an action related to version control. Initially this overhead problem may not have much impact 
on the project but in the long term, the productivity of the team can be negatively affected.
Another software development model that has acquired popularity due to the competitive advantages 
it brings to development teams is the \ac{SPL} development model~\cite{pohl+05sple}. Like the DSD 
model, the SPL also suffers from an overhead problem. In this case the problem is caused by the initial 
coding and configuration that must be done at the beginning of a project.
With CollabIDE, we aim to solve the overhead problems that exists in these development models with 
features that aim to reduce the time developers must spend doing actions related to version control or 
setting up a project that uses \acp{SPL}.
